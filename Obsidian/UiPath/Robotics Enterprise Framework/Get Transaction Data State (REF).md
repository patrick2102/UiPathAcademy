Retrieves one by one the transaction items.

Two possibilities:
1. New [[Transaction]] item is received and the robot executes the [[Process Transaction State (REF)]]
2. The other is that all transactions are processed, and not more data is available and jumps to the [[End Process State (REF)]]

Invoked workflows:
- GetTransactionData.xaml
