Some processes are better expressed as interconnected states which are executed again and again whenever necessary. A set of activities are performed in each state and then a condition is evaluated to determine what state to transition to next. For example, a turnstile is a state machine with, at a minimum, the states: idle, access granted, access denied and off. 

  

- In the **Idle state** the gate is locked while the machine waits for an access card. When a person presents an access card, the machine evaluates if the card must be accepted.
- If the card is accepted, the turnstile transitions to the **Access Granted** **state** where the gate is open to allow one person to enter. After the person enters or a certain period of time passes, the machine transitions back to the **Idle** state. 
- If the card is rejected, the turnstile transitions to the **Access Denied** **state** where this message is displayed and the gate remains locked. After a certain period of time passes, the machine transitions back to the **Idle** **state**.
- When a technician enters the correct code, the machine transitions to the **Off state.**

1. The **Entry** section contains the activities that are to be performed when the state is entered.
2. The **Exit** section contains the activities that are to be performed upon exiting the state.
3. The T**ransition** sections lets you add activities that will be performed before switching from the current state to the desired state .

**best practices while working with State Machines**
- **Use State Machines for Complex Workflows:** State Machines are ideal for managing complex workflows with multiple states, decision points, and conditional transitions. Utilize them when you need to handle intricate business processes that involve various steps and stages.
    
- **Use Transitions Wisely:** Utilize transitions to move between states based on specific conditions. Keep transitions simple and easy to understand. Avoid overly complex transition conditions that may cause confusion. 
    
- **Error Handling and Recovery:** Incorporate error handling mechanisms within states or as a separate state for robust automation. Implement "Try-Catch" blocks to catch exceptions and handle failures gracefully. Plan for potential errors and create appropriate error recovery strategies.
    
- **Clear Naming Conventions:** Use descriptive and meaningful names for states and transitions to enhance the readability of your State Machine. This helps other team members understand the workflow easily.
    
- **Logging and Debugging:** Implement logging and debugging mechanisms to track the progress of your State Machine. Proper logging will assist in identifying issues and monitoring the automation's performance.
    
- **Testing and Validation:** Thoroughly test your State Machine with various scenarios to ensure that it behaves as expected. Validate its performance, handling of different conditions, and response to exceptions.
    
- **Documentation:** Provide clear documentation for your State Machine, explaining its purpose, states, transitions, and usage guidelines. Proper documentation helps with knowledge transfer and maintenance.
