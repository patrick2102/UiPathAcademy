Sequences:
- In Sequences, the steps of a process execute in a clear sequential succession. Decision trees are rarely used.



Flowcharts
- In Flowcharts, the individual activities are a bit more difficult to read and edit, but the execution flow between them is much clearer. 


Control flow statements:
- Conditional
	- If
	- Else If
	- Switch
- Loops
	- While
	- Do While
	- For Each


Best practices:
1. Sequences are best suited for simple scenarios when there are few if any decisions.
2. Flowcharts are best suited for when multiple decisions need to be taken
3. IF are good for short balanced branches. Nested IFs should be avoided.
4. 
5.
6. When using Switch activities, always include a default case to handle unexpected cases that may occur. 
7.


Else If Activity contains a series of conditions, with then statements inside. Very similar to switches


Do While:
- Execute once then check again

While:
- Check then execute if condition is met. Repeat.

For Each:
- Goes through each item in a collection.


Main difference between Do While and While:
- Do While runs at least once. While checks condition first, which might make it not run at all.
