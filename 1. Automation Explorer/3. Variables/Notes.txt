Learning goals:

1. Explain what variables are and what they are used for.

2. Create and configure variables in an automation project.

3. List the UiPath Automation best practices when working with variables.



Variable contains a name, type, scope, and optionally default value.

Definition of a variable:
Storage location that can hold multiple values of the same datatype.


Good practices with variables:
- use meaningful names for variables.
- Use Pascal Case

Variables can be created:
- In the Variables panel, by adding a new line at the bottom.
- Activity properties panel, by pressing Ctrl + K
- From the body of an Activity by pressing Ctrl + K, or right clicking and selecting "Create Variable" option in an input field that can accept variables
- Data Manager Panel, by clicking new variable
- And by right clicking the activity and pressing "Create Variable", this works only the scope of the activity


There are 4 main ways for a variable to be created:
- Data Manager:
	- Click "New Variable"
- Body of an Activity
	- Press Ctrl + K
	- Right clicking and selecting "New Variable"
	- Scoped to the scope of the sequence the activity takes place in
- Properties Panel:
	- Press Ctrl + K
- Variables panel:
	- Adding new line


A workflow is made of activities, interconnected through variables to form a routine.

Routine typically has an input and an output. It defines the flow of automation.


Predefined workflow layouts:
- Sequences
- Flowcharts
- State Machines

The fastest, most reliable, and useful way of automating a process is to break it down into smaller bits. 

Arguments contain a direction:
- In
	- Only to input data that the invoked workflow
- Out
	- Only to extract data from the invoked workflow
- In/Out
	- Works both ways.

An argument direction should always prefix the name of the argument e.g. out_Sum

Creating arguments in activity panel:
- From the activity panel in an avtivity input field
	- Select In or Out argument fron context menu
	- Alternatively press Ctrl+M or Ctrl+Shift+M
- From Expression Editor:
	- Select a part of the expression and press Ctrl+M (for In) or Ctrl+Shift+M (for Out)



Global constants and variables can be created only from the Data Manger panel.
