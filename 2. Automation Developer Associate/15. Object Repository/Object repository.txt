		- A UI Descriptor is a superset of selectors. It holds information for uniquely identifying elements on the screen.
	- ui applications
		- A UI Application is a targeted application that can have multiple versions and each version can have multiple screens. 
	- screens
		- Screens are UI Scopes that are either extracted from activities inside the workflow or are generated at element capture time. A screen groups together multiple elements belonging to the same screen. 
	- ui elements
		- UI Elements contain full or partial element selectors, anchor selectors, screen and element image capture context, and other metadata that describes the element on the screen.
	- ui libraries
		- A UI Library is an encapsulation of elements grouped by applications, application versions, and screens. 
	- ui activities
		-  UI Activities allows you to view a list of all your UI activities inside your process.
