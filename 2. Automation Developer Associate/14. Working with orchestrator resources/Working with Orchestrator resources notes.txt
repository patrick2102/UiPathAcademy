Queues are typically used with the Dispatcher-Performer model of running automations:

- The stage in which data is taken and fed into a queue in Orchestrator, from where it can be taken and processed by the robots is called Dispatcher.
- The stage in which the data is processed is called Performer.


Items that have a Deadline, as follows: 
1. In order of Priority—and
2. According to the set Deadline for items with the same Priority.

Items with no Deadline, in order of Priority—and
- According to the rule First In, First Out for items with the same Priority.

After the Stop signal is sent from the orchestrator, the process ends when it is safe to do so. This requires using the Should-Stop activity and a Stop mechanism in a workflow. 


Types of business processes:
- Linear:
	- Process steps are only executed once
	-
- Iterative
	- The steps of the process are executed multiple times
	- But each time different data items are used
	- Example, retrieving multiple emails instead of just one
- Transactional
	- similar to iterative
	- each repeatable part is processed independently
	- these repeatable parts are called transactions
	
	

What is a transaction?
- A transaction represents the minimum (atomic) amount of data and the necessary steps required to process the data, by fulfilling a section of a business process. A typical example would be a process that reads a single email from a mailbox and extracts data from it.
